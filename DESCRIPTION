Description: The goal of 'ggcoverage' is to simplify the process of visualizing genomic coverage. It contains functions to 
    load genomic data with BAM/BigWig/BedGraph file format, create genomic coverage plot, add various annotations to 
    the coverage plot, including gene annotation, transcription annotation, ideogram annotation and peak annotation.
